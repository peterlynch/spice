/**
 * Restlet routing calls to one of the attached routes. Each route can compute
 * an affinity score for each call depending on various criteria. The attach()
 * method allow the creation of routes based on URI patterns matching the
 * beginning of a the resource reference's remaining part.<br>
 * <br>
 * In addition, several routing modes are supported, implementing various
 * algorithms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Best match (default)</li>
 * <li>First match</li>
 * <li>Last match</li>
 * <li>Random match</li>
 * <li>Round robin</li>
 * <li>Custom</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Note that for routes using URI patterns will update the resource reference's
 * base reference during the routing if they are selected. It is also important
 * to know that the routing is very strict about path separators in your URI
 * patterns. Finally, you can modify the list of routes while handling incoming
 * calls as the delegation code is ensured to be thread-safe.<br>
 * <br>
 * Concurrency note: instances of this class or its subclasses can be invoked by
 * several threads at the same time and therefore must be thread-safe. You
 * should be especially careful when storing state in member variables.
