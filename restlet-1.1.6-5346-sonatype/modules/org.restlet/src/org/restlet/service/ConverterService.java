 * Service converting message entities into higher-level objects. As the default
 * implementation doesn't do any convertion by default, you have to subclass it
 * and update the Application's "converterService" property with your own
 * instance.<br>
 * <br>
 * Once this done, any Restlet or Resource that is part of this application can
 * easily convert from representations to objects and the other way around. You
 * just have to use the getEntityAsObject() method to convert a message's
 * representation into a higher-level object and the setEntity(Object) method to
 * convert a higher-level object into a representation.

 * @author Jerome Louvel
 * @deprecated Since 1.1 with no replacement as it doesn't fit well with content
 *             negotiation. Most users prefer to handle those conversion in
