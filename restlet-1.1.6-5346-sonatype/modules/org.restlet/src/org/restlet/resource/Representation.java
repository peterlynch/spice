/**
 * Current or intended state of a resource. The content of a representation can
 * be retrieved several times if there is a stable and accessible source, like a
 * local file or a string. When the representation is obtained via a temporary
 * source like a network socket, its content can only be retrieved once. The
 * "transient" and "available" properties are available to help you figure out
 * those aspects at runtime.<br>
 * <br>
 * For performance purpose, it is essential that a minimal overhead occurs upon
 * initialization. The main overhead must only occur during invocation of
 * content processing methods (write, getStream, getChannel and toString).<br>
 * <br>
 * "REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation to
 * capture the current or intended state of that resource and transferring that
 * representation between components. A representation is a sequence of bytes,
 * plus representation metadata to describe those bytes. Other commonly used but
 * less precise names for a representation include: document, file, and HTTP
 * message entity, instance, or variant." Roy T. Fielding
