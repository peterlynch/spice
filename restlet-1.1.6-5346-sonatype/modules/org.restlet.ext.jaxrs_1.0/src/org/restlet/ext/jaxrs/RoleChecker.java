/**
 * <p>
 * This interface provides user role checks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because the Restlet API does not support its own mechanism for role checks
 * (as e.g. the Servlet API), you must use this inteface if you need role checks
 * in a JAX-RS application.<br>
 * This interface is used to check, if a user is in a role. Implementations must
 * be thread save.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is used by {@link SecurityContext#isUserInRole(String)}. The
 * JAX-RS runtime delegates this method call along with the {@link Principal} of
 * the HTTP request to method {@link #isInRole(Principal, String)}, the only
 * method of this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you need user access control, you must give an instance of this inteface
 * to the {@link JaxRsApplication}. If you do not give an instance, every call
 * of {@link SecurityContext#isUserInRole(String)} results in an Internal Server
 * Error (HTTP status 500), which will get returned to the client (see
 * {@link #REJECT_WITH_ERROR}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To check if the user is authenticated, use any Restlet {@link Guard}.
 * </p>
