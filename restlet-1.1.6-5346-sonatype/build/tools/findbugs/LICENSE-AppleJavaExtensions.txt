This file details our unsuccessful attempts to find out from Apple
what the exact licensing terms of AppleJavaExtensions.jar are.
It seems clear that the intent is to allow free redistribution.

AppleJavaExtensions.jar is the only code in FindBugs covered by an
Apple license, and is neither required by nor included in the binary
distributions of FindBugs. It is only needed when building from source.
So, as long as you're just using binary releases, there should be no
licensing issues. If you are building FindBugs from source and licensing
is a concern, read on.


AppleJavaExtensions is distributed with the following README file:

--------------begin README--------------
AppleJavaExtensions
v 1.2

This is a pluggable jar of stub classes representing the new Apple eAWT
and eIO APIs for Java 1.4 on Mac OS X.  The purpose of these stubs is
to allow for compilation of eAWT- or eIO-referencing code on platforms
other than Mac OS X.  The jar file is enclosed in a zip archive for
easy expansion on other platforms.

These stubs are not intended for the runtime classpath on non-Mac platforms.
Please see the OSXAdapter sample for how to write cross-platform code
that uses eAWT.

The license for AppleJavaExtensions.jar is murky, because Apple does
not disclose how it is licensed.  We believe that we have permission
to distribute it, based on the following email.  Despite the email's
statement that license boilerplate would be included in the readme,
as of July 2006 this has not happened.
