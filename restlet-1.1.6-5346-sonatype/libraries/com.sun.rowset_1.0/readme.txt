JDBC Rowset - 1.0.1 Implementation
------------------------------------

"A RowSet object is a container for tabular data, encapsulating 
a set of zero or more rows that have been retrieved from a data 
source. In a basic implementation of the RowSet interface, the 
rows are retrieved from a JDBC data source, but a rowset may be 
customized so that its data can also be from a spreadsheet, a flat 
file, or any other data source with a tabular format. A RowSet 
object extends the ResultSet interface, which means that it can be 
scrollable, can be updatable, and can do anything a ResultSet 
object can do."
