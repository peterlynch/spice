/**
 * A <tt>Realm</tt> is a security component that can access application-specific security entities
 * such as users, roles, and permissions to determine authentication and authorization operations.
 *
 * <p><tt>Realm</tt>s usually have a 1-to-1 correspondance with a datasource such as a relational database,
 * file sysetem, or other similar resource.  As such, implementations of this interface use datasource-specific APIs to
 * determine authorization data (roles, permissions, etc), such as JDBC, File IO, Hibernate or JPA, or any other
 * Data Access API.  They are essentially security-specific
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Access_Object" target="_blank">DAO</a>s.
 *
 * <p>Because most of these datasources usually contain Subject (a.k.a. User) information such as usernames and
 * passwords, a Realm can act as a pluggable authentication module in a PAM configuration.  This allows a Realm to
 * perform <i>both</i> authentication and authorization duties for a single datasource, which caters to the large
 * majority of applications.  If for some reason you don't want your Realm implementation to perform authentication
 * duties, you should override the {@link #supports(org.jsecurity.authc.AuthenticationToken)} method to always
 * return <tt>false</tt>.
 *
 * <p>Because every application is different, security data such as users and roles can be
 * represented in any number of ways.  JSecurity tries to maintain a non-intrusive development philosophy whenever
 * possible - it does not require you to implement or extend any <tt>User</tt>, <tt>Group</tt> or <tt>Role</tt>
 * interfaces or classes.
 *
 * <p>Instead, JSecurity allows applications to implement this interface to access environment-specific datasources
 * and data model objects.  The implementation can then be plugged in to the application's JSecurity configuration.
 * This modular technique abstracts away any environment/modeling details and allows JSecurity to be deployed in
 * practically any application environment.
 *
 * <p>Most users will not implement the <tt>Realm</tt> interface directly, but will extend one of the subclasses,
 * {@link AuthenticatingRealm AuthenticatingRealm} or {@link AuthorizingRealm}, greatly reducing the effort requird
 * to implement a <tt>Realm</tt> from scratch.</p>
