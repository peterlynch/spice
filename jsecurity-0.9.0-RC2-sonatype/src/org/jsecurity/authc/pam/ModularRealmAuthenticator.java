/**
 * A <tt>ModularRealmAuthenticator</tt> delgates account lookups to a pluggable (modular) collection of
 * {@link Realm}s.  This enables PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) behavior in JSecurity.
 * In addition to authorization duties, a JSecurity Realm can also be thought of a PAM 'module'.
 *
 * <p>Using this Authenticator allows you to &quot;plug-in&quot; your own
 * <tt>Realm</tt>s as you see fit.  Common realms are those based on accessing
 * LDAP, relational databases, file systems, etc.
 *
 * <p>If only one realm is configured (this is often the case for most applications), authentication success is naturally
 * only dependent upon invoking this one Realm's
 * {@link Realm#getAuthenticationInfo(org.jsecurity.authc.AuthenticationToken)} method.
 *
 * <p>But if two or more realms are configured, PAM behavior is implemented by iterating over the collection of realms
 * and interacting with each over the course of the authentication attempt.  As this is more complicated, this
 * authenticator allows customized behavior for interpreting what happens when interacting with multiple realms - for
 * example, you might require all realms to be successful during the attempt, or perhaps only at least one must be
 * successful, or some other interpretation.  This customized behavior can be performed via the use of a
 * {@link #setModularAuthenticationStrategy(ModularAuthenticationStrategy) ModularAuthenticationStrategy}, which
 * you can inject as a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>The strategy object provides callback methods that allow you to
 * determine what constitutes a success or failure in a multi-realm (PAM) scenario.  And because this only makes sense
 * in a mult-realm scenario, the strategy object is only utilized when more than one Realm is configured.
 *
 * <p>For greater security in a multi-realm configuration, unless overridden, the default implementation is the
 * {@link AllSuccessfulModularAuthenticationStrategy AllSuccessfulModularAuthenticationStrategy}
