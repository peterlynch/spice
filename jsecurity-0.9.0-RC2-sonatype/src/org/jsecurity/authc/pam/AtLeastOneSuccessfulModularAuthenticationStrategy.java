/**
 * <tt>ModularAuthenticationStrategy</tt> implementation that requires <em>at least one</em> configured realm to
 * successfully process the submitted <tt>AuthenticationToken</tt> during the log-in attempt.
 *
 * <p>This means any number of configured realms do not have to support the submitted log-in token, or they may
 * be unable to acquire <tt>AuthenticationInfo</tt> for the token, but as long as at least one can do both, this
 * Strategy implementation will allow the log-in process to be successful.
 *
 * <p>Note that this implementation will aggregate the account data from <em>all</em> successfully consulted
 * realms during the authentication attempt. If you want only the account data from the first successfully
 * consulted realm and want to ignore all subsequent realms, use the
 * {@link FirstSuccessfulAuthenticationStrategy FirstSuccessfulAuthenticationStrategy} instead.
