/**
 * The Spring/Hibernate sample application's one and only configured JSecurity Realm.
 *
 * <p>Because a Realm is really just a security-specific DAO, we could have just made Hibernate calls directly
 * in the implementation and named it a 'HibernateRealm' or something similar.</p>
 *
 * <p>But we've decided to make the calls to the database using a UserDAO, since a DAO would be used in other areas
 * of a 'real' application in addition to here. We felt it better to use that same DAO to show code re-use.
 * That is, in a real app, there is no need to duplicate Hibernate calls in the Realm implementation if you've already
 * got a User DAO (as most apps would).  So, we just use that UserDAO here.</p>
