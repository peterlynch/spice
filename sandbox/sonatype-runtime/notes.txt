I want to contribute the webdav capability to the app server, complete contributions so I need to put something in the component that knows how to add itself. then allow it to be configured. 

- discover the capabilities and make the defaults just work together
- we know the dependencies of the capabilities so just wire them in
- create some visual tools for dealing with this

- i just want this JAR picked up and have all the deps be pulled in correctly and make something
  that a developer can work with -- and match what is deployed
- default configuration
- libraries - so how to package the dependencies and load them in the container

- have standard notes attached to applications and automatically entering them in JIRA
